Register File is a fundamental component in the MIPS architecture

### What is a Register File?
In a CPU, the register file is a small, fast memory unit that stores data the processor needs to access quickly.

- It holds output values generated by the ALU — that’s the Arithmetic Logic Unit, which performs all arithmetic and logical operations.

- Register as temporary storage is much faster than main memory.
- Registers help reduce the time it takes to fetch data and keep instruction execution smooth and efficient.

### Program Counter (PC)

- Holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.
- Automatically increments after each instruction unless a branch or jump occurs.

### HI and LO Registers

- These are used when executing multiplication and division operations.
- HI holds the high-order bits or quotients,
- LO stores the low-order bits or remainders.
