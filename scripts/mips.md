Cisc `complex instruction set`
RISC `reduce instruction set`

most computer processors the CPUs were getting more more complicated and the idea was was that if you could make the hardware sort of mirror what the software does then of course it would be  quicker so as you wrote a program in the

- you wrote a program in those if it starts to produce some instructions if those instructions could be executed more and more in the hardware with less and less instructions that would make the whole thing go faster and 
there were also other considerations like memory was expensive so if you had shorter program that each instruction could do.


General-Purpose Registers:
- Registers are part of the CPU â€” much faster than accessing data from RAM.
- MIPS avoids frequent memory access, improving performance.

1. Simple Instructions

- RISC CPUs use a small set of simple instructions.
- Each instruction is designed to be executed in a single clock cycle (as much as possible).

2. Load/Store Architecture
- Only load (lw) and store (sw) instructions access memory.

3. Fixed-Length Instructions
- 32 in MIPS
